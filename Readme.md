Serve
=====

`serve` expects a certain structure in order to work properly. It assumes
there's a `lib`-directory with index-files for each front-end technology.
It will then build to the `build`-directory and serve `index.html` as a
fall-back if no other resource matches the URI.


Example
-------

    lib/
      index.css
      index.html
      index.js
